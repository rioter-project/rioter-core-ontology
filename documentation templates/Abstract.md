The Rioter ontology is focused on a data model for meeting IoT services with real measurements and the corresponding real-objects (even devices or natural objects).

The proposed ontology is an extensi√≥n of SAREF ontology towards water domain.	The  extension has been focused in the following points: 

* Link physical and digital dimensions.
* Extends measurements towards considering different variable indexes and scales. 
* Link a measurement with their corresponding data quality.  

Considering these extensions, the descriptive diagram is presented in the following figure:
